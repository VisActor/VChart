# Event

The VChart instance provides methods related to event monitoring, and developers can monitor events to meet business needs. In addition to basic dom events, the events provided on VChart also include component events, TTL events, etc.

Below is a simple monitor diagram `click` Examples of events:

```ts
vchart.on('click', params => {
  console.log('Hooray, You are captured');
});
```

## Event API

The registration and uninstallation methods of events are provided on the VChart instance:

- Register an event

```ts
on(event: string, callback: (params: EventParams) => void): void;
on(event: string, query: EventQuery, callback: (params: EventParams) => void): void;
```

- Uninstall event

```ts
off(event: string, callback: (params: EventParams) => void): void;
```

Example:

```ts
vchart.on('pointerdown', e => {
  console.log('Hooray, You are captured');
}); // bind event
vchart.on('pointerdown', { level: 'model', type: 'axis' }, e => {
  console.log('Hooray, You are captured');
}); // bind axis `pointerdown` event
vchart.off('pointerdown', callback); // off event
```

### event parameters

All events provide parameters of the following structure:

```ts
type EventParams = {
  /**
   * event object
   */
  event: SuperEvent;
  /**
   * For different events to store the data expected to be carried
   */
  value?: any;
  /**
   * The mark of the event source
   */
  mark?: IMark;
  /**
   * The model of the event source
   */
  model?: IModel;
  /**
   * The chart of the event source
   */
  chart?: IChart;
  /**
   * The data of the primitive picked up by the event
   */
  datum?: Datum;
  /**
   * Picked graphics node
   */
  node?: INode;
};

type SuperEvent = Event & {
  [key: string]: any;
};
```

### Event filtering

If you need to specifically monitor events in a certain part of the chart, you can use the built-in query rules for configuration. Currently, we provide the following filtering rules:

1. `source`, filter according to the event source, that is, listen to the events of the window or the chart itself.

```ts
//Listen to the pointerdown event on the window
vchart.on('pointerdown', { source: 'window' }, () => {});
```

2. `level`, filter according to the event bubbling level. The bubbling order of events is: 'mark' -> 'model' -> 'chart' -> 'vchart'.

```ts
//Listen to the pointerdown event on the bar primitive
vchart.on('pointerdown', { level: 'mark', type: 'bar' }, () => {});
```

3. `nodeName`, filter according to the picked graphics node name. Inside vchart, some component names will be built in for some components to facilitate user identification.

```ts
//Listen to the pointerdown event on the axis text
vchart.on('pointerdown', { nodeName: 'axis-label' }, () => {});
```

4. `markName`, filter according to the name of mark primitive.

```ts
//Listen to the pointerdown event on the bar primitive
vchart.on('pointerdown', { markName: 'bar' }, () => {});
```

5. `type`, **only used in scenarios where level is 'mark' or 'model'**, is used to filter mark types or chart component element model types

```ts
//Listen to the pointerdown event on the coordinate axis
vchart.on('pointerdown', { level: 'model', type: 'axis' }, () => {});
```

6. `id`, filter based on the id configured by the user on the spec for the chart component

```ts
//Listen to the component event with id 'axis-left'
vchart.on('pointerdown', { id: 'axis-left' }, () => {});
```

7. `filter`, when none of the above filtering configurations meet the needs, you can filter through a custom filtering function

```ts
vchart.on('pointerdown', { filter: ({model} => model.id === 45) }, () => {});
```

#### Listen to **component** events through event filtering

Through the following event filtering rules, we can monitor the events of each component on the VChart example

```ts
/**
 * 'pointerdown' is the event name
 * Need to declare in event filtering:
 * 1. `level` is declared as 'model'
 * 2. `type` declares the name of the component
 */
vchart.on('pointerdown', { level: 'model', type: 'axis' }, e => {
  // The specific graphics picked up by the current event can be obtained through e.event.target
  console.log('axis pointerdown', e.event.target);
});
```

However, it should be noted that not all components enable event interaction by default. For components that are turned off by default, users need to manually enable them on the spec corresponding to the component (such as enabling label event interaction: `label: { interactive: true }`) , the following table lists the current component names of our VChart and how its events are turned on and off by default. You can refer to this table for specific use.

| Component type | Whether to enable event support by default |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| axis           | Yes                                        |
| dataZoom       | Yes                                        |
| indicator      | Yes                                        |
| legend         | Yes                                        |
| mapLabel       | Yes                                        |
| customMark     | Yes                                        |
| title          | Yes                                        |
| markLine       | No                                         |
| markArea       | No                                         |
| markPoint      | No                                         |
| label          | No                                         |
| totalLabel     | No                                         |

#### Monitor **mark primitive** events through event filtering

If you want to listen to the events of mark primitives, you can do it in two ways:

1. Use `markName` to filter, such as:

```ts
// Listen to the pointerdown event on the bar primitive
vchart.on('pointerdown', { markName: 'bar' }, (e: EventParams) => {
  console.log('bar pointerdown', e);
});
```

2. Use the `{ level: 'mark', type: 'bar' }` rule to filter, such as:

```ts
// Listen to the pointerdown event on the bar primitive
vchart.on('pointerdown', { level: 'mark', type: 'bar' }, (e: EventParams) => {
  console.log('bar pointerdown', e);
});
```

If you want to listen to the events of all primitives, you only need to declare `level: 'mark'`, such as `vchart.on('pointerdown', { level: 'mark'}, e => {})`

The specific primitive types (corresponding to the types configured on the spec) are: 'point', 'line', 'area', 'bar', 'bar3d', 'boxPlot', 'outlier', 'circlePacking', 'dot ', 'funnel','funnel3d', 'link', 'pie', 'rose', 'pie3d', 'word', 'fillingWord', etc.
