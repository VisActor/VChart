#${prefix} barWidth(number|string)

The width of the column can be set as an absolute pixel value or as a percentage (such as '10%'). If not configured, it will be adaptive by default.

- `number` type, representing pixel value
- `string` type, percentage usage, such as '10%', this value is the proportion of bandWidth relative to scale

#${prefix} barMinWidth(number|string)

The minimum width of the column, you can set an absolute pixel value, or you can use a percentage (such as '10%').

- `number` type, representing pixel value
- `string` type, percentage usage, such as '10%', this value is the proportion of bandWidth relative to scale

#${prefix} barMaxWidth(number|string)

The maximum width of the column, you can set an absolute pixel value, or you can use a percentage (such as '10%').

- `number` type, representing pixel value
- `string` type, percentage usage, such as '10%', this value is the proportion of bandWidth relative to scale

#${prefix} barGapInGroup(number|string)

Supported since `1.2.0` version, it is used to adjust the column spacing within each group in the grouped column chart. You can set the absolute pixel value or use a percentage (such as '10%'). When there are multiple layers of grouping, you can use an array to set the spacing of different levels, such as [10, '20%'], which means that the spacing of the first layer of grouping is 10px, and the spacing of the second layer of grouping is '20%'.

If the number of arrays in `barGapInGroup` is less than the number of grouping levels, the last value will be used for subsequent grouping spacing.

- `number` type, representing pixel value
- `string` type, percentage usage, such as '10%', the value is the proportion of the actual column width (barWidth)

#${prefix} barMinHeight(number)

Supported since `1.4.0` version, used to configure the minimum height of the bar, which can be used to prevent visual adjustments of a data item whose value is too small.

#${prefix} stackCornerRadius(number|number[]|Function)

Supported since `1.4.0` version, used to configure the overall rounded corners of stacked bar groups.

Supported since `1.12.4` version, you can use callback to set stackCornerRadius, The function type is defined as follows:

```ts
/**
 * @param attr bar group attribute
 * @param datum bar group datum
 * @param ctx context of series
 * @returns
 */
export type IStackCornerRadiusCallback = (
  attr: IRectGraphicAttribute,
  datum: Datum,
  ctx: ISeriesMarkAttributeContext
) => number | number[];
```
