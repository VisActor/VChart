### x(string|number|function)

Annotation target: Cartesian coordinate system x coordinate space.
The boundary of the marking area on the x-axis, used together with markArea.x1 to construct the marking area. You can configure the value on the x-axis, relative position, or aggregation calculation type.

- Relative position (string): Supported since `1.7.0` version, x can be configured in the form of '15%' percentage, which is used to indicate that x is drawn on the horizontal axis (from left to right) of the region where the marker is located. 15/10 position.

- Callback

{{ use: component-marker-aggregation-type() }}

### x1(string|number|function)

### y(string|number|function)

The boundary of the marking area on the y-axis, which together with markArea.y1 constructs the marking area. You can configure the value on the y-axis, relative position, or aggregation calculation type.

### y1(string|number|function)

The boundary of the marking area on the y-axis, which together with markArea.y constructs the marking area. You can configure the value on the y-axis, relative position, or aggregation calculation type.

- Relative position (string): Supported since `1.7.0` version, y1 can be configured in the form of '15%' percentage, which is used to indicate that y1 is drawn on the vertical axis (from top to bottom) of the region where the marker is located. 15/10 position.

### angle (string | number | function)

Since the `1.11.0` version, the reference line is on the angle axis of the polar coordinate system, and the value on the angle axis can be configured, or aggregated calculation, or self-calculation through data in the form of callbacks.

** Note that the usage scenario of this property is in the polar coordinate system: **

1. Configure the angle and angle1 properties together to draw the sector annotation area enclosed by angle and angle1
2. With the configuration of radius, radius1, angle and angle1 properties, it is used to draw the ring label range with the inner and outer radii of radius and radius1 respectively, and the angle is angle to angle1.

### radius (string | number | function)

Since the `1.11.0` version, the reference line is on the radius axis of the polar coordinate system, and the value on the radius axis can be configured, or aggregated calculations, or self-calculated through the data in the form of callbacks.

** Note that the usage scenario of this property is in the polar coordinate system: **

1. With the configuration of radius and radius1 properties, it is used to draw the annular labeling range with inner and outer radii of radius and radius1 respectively.
2. With the configuration of radius, radius1, angle and angle1 properties, it is used to draw the ring label range with the inner and outer radii of radius and radius1 respectively, and the angle is angle to angle1.

### angle1 (string | number | function)

Since the `1.11.0` version, the reference line is on the angle axis of the polar coordinate system, and the value on the angle axis can be configured, or aggregated calculation, or self-calculation through data in the form of callbacks.

** Note that the usage scenario of this property is in the polar coordinate system: **
