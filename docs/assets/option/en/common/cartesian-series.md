#${prefix} xField(string|string[])

x field. It can be declared as an array type, and the data will be grouped in sequence according to the declared fields.

#${prefix} yField(string|string[])

y field. It can be declared as an array type, and the data will be grouped in sequence according to the declared fields.

#${prefix} zField(string|string[])

z field. It can be declared as an array type, and the data will be grouped in sequence according to the declared fields. (Normally, it doesn't need to be configured. If you want a 3D scatter plot, 3D line chart, or 3D area chart, you can configure it, and you can also configure a z-axis)

{{ if: ${x2Field} }}
#${prefix} x2Field(string)

Used for interval data, declaring the data field for the end of the interval.

{{ /if }}

{{ if: ${y2Field} }}
#${prefix} y2Field(string)

Used for interval data, declaring the data field for the end of the interval.

{{ /if }}

#${prefix} sortDataByAxis(boolean)

sortDataByAxis field. Specifying whether the data is sorted in axis order can ensure that the graph is drawn in the correct order when the order of the data is uncertain. If you expect not to disrupt the order of the original data, configure it to false.
