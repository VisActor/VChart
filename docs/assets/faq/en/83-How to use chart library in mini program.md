# How to use the chart library in a mini program?

## Problem Description

I want to draw a chart on a mini program. Are there any out-of-the-box charting libraries you recommend?

## solution

Different chart libraries have different solutions. The following introduces the support of [VChart](https://www.visactor.io/vchart/) chart library. Currently, VChart supports Feishu applets, Feishu widgets and The chart rendering of the taro cross-terminal framework is very simple to use. You only need to declare the corresponding cross-terminal environment parameters when initializing the chart example. The use and function of the chart configuration items are consistent with the PC performance.

## Code Example

We provide demo examples of Feishu widgets and Feishu applet:
