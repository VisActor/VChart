# line chart overlap
In a line chart, when data points are too densely packed, prevent the data points from overlapping to ensure a clearer representation of the trend and value of each line.

## Key option

- `markOverlap` declared as whether to enable anti-overlap

## Demo source

```javascript livedemo
const response = await fetch('https://lf9-dp-fe-cms-tos.byteorg.com/obj/bit-cloud/overlap-data.json');
const data = await response.json();

const dataSeries = [];
data.forEach(d => {
  dataSeries.push({
    ...d,
    type: 'a'
  });
  dataSeries.push({
    ...d,
    y: d.y + 20,
    type: 'b'
  });
});
const spec = {
    type: 'line',
    xField: 'x',
    yField: 'y',
    seriesField: 'type',
    markOverlap: true,
    stack: true,
    data: [
      {
        name: 'line',
        values: dataSeries
      }
    ]
  };

const vchart = new VChart(spec, { dom: CONTAINER_ID });
vchart.renderAsync();

// Just for the convenience of console debugging, DO NOT COPY!
window['vchart'] = vchart;
```
