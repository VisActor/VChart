## Lark Mini-Program Widget

[Lark Mini-Program Widget](https://open.feishu.cn/document/client-docs/block/block-introduction) is a lightweight functional block created by Lark. It is defined as a carrier of an information unit that integrates rendering, interaction, and data. VChart can be used for chart drawing on the Lark Mini-Program Widget.

## How to Use

Tip: **Currently, VChart (@visactor/vchart) is not built into Lark Mini-Program Widget, so you need to manually import it into your Lark Mini-Program Widget project.**

## How to get VChart

At present, VChart's umd packaging products are required on the widget. You can get them through the following channels:

1.  Get it directly from the warehouse. [Packages/block-vchart/block/vchart/index.js](https://github.com/VisActor/VChart/blob/main/packages/block-vchart/block/vchart/index.js) , we will update each code packet of the released version
2.  Get it from the following free CDNs

```html
<!-- unpkg -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@visactor/vchart/build/index.min.js"></script>

<!-- jsDelivr -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@visactor/vchart/build/index.min.js"></script>
```

## Demo Example

We provide a complete example project for reference during development: [https://github.com/VisActor/VChart/tree/main/packages/block-vchart](https://github.com/VisActor/VChart/tree/main/packages/block-vchart)

**Prerequisite: Please refer to Lark Mini-Program Widget's [official tutorial documentation](https://open.feishu.cn/document/client-docs/block/block-introduction) to get an idea of how to develop Lark Mini-Program Widget.**

Below we will introduce how to use VChart on the Lark Mini-Program Widget from the `js`, `ttml`, `ttss` sections.

### index.ttml

In `index.ttml`, declare the following code as the canvas carrier using the chart capability. The attributes here are `class`, `id`, and `canvas-id`.

- `class`: CSS class name, which will be automatically linked with the class set in `index.ttss`.
- `id`: For querying the DOM in the `index.js` below.
- `canvas-id`: A special identifier, used to distinguish elements by the compiler service.

Additionally, VChart uses HTML rendering for tooltips by default, but the Mini-Program Widget environment does not support HTML. So we need to use the canvas version of the tooltip, and to improve interaction performance, we need to use another layer of canvas as the tooltip's drawing carrier. **Notice the order in which the canvas is declared (below the draw canvas layer) and disable tooltip canvas events**.

```html
<view class="vchart">
  <!-- Drawing layer canvas -->
  <canvas
    class="cs-canvas"
    id="line_draw_canvas"
    canvas-id="line_draw_canvas"
    bindtouchstart="bindChartEvent"
    bindtouchmove="bindChartEvent"
    bindtouchend="bindChartEvent"
  >
  </canvas>
  <!-- Pay attention to the canvas order -->
  <!-- Tooltip canvas -->
  <canvas
    id="line_tooltip_canvas"
    canvas-id="line_tooltip_canvas"
    class="cs-tooltip-canvas"
    user-interaction-enabled="{{false}}"
  >
  </canvas>
</view>
```

### index.ttss

In this part, developers need to set the styles for the elements in `index.ttml` above. It's important to ensure that the chart container canvas has a width and height.

```css
/* chart */
.vchart {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  margin: 12px 8px;
  height: 400px;
  display: block;
}

.cs-canvas {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: block;
}

.cs-tooltip-canvas {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

### index.js

The root index.js in the block, where you import VChart and create a VChart instance. Developers need to query the DOM in the block's lifecycle `onReady`. After getting the DOM, start creating a VChart instance.

```js
import pieSpec from "./data/pie";
import VChart from './vchart/index'; // Assuming the VChart script is placed in this directory
...
onReady(){
    tt.createSelectorQuery()
      .select('#line_draw_canvas')
      .boundingClientRect(domRef => {
        if (!domRef) {
          console.error(`Canvas #line not found`);
          return;
        }
        const chartInstance = new VChart(
          {
            width: domRef.width,
            height: domRef.height,
            ...pieSpec
          },
          // The following is the configuration for the miniApp environment
          {
            mode: 'miniApp',
            modeParams: {
              domref: domRef,
              force: true,
              canvasIdLists: ['line_draw_canvas', 'line_tooltip_canvas'],
              tooltipCanvasId: 'line_tooltip_canvas',
              freeCanvasIdx: 1
            },
            dpr: this.dpr,
            renderCanvas: 'line_draw_canvas'
          }
        );
        chartInstance.renderAsync();
      })
    .exec();
}
```

### Event Binding

You can see that the canvas with the id "line_draw_canvas" in index.ttml above has bound `touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend` events. Once bound, you need to write the `bindChartEvent` event handler function in index.js:

```js
// index.js
methods: {
    init() {
      // do something
    },
    // Handle events
    bindChartEvent(event) {
      const id = event.target.id.split('_')[0];
      // The following is example code, i.e., find the corresponding VChart instance by id, and the actual scenario depends on your specific situation to get the VChart instance
      const targetChart = this.data.chartList.find(x => x.id === id);
      const chartInstance = targetChart?.chart;
      if (chartInstance) {
        event.target = chartInstance.getCanvas(); // Tip: Must be set
        chartInstance.getStage().window.dispatchEvent(event);
      }
    },
  }
```

#### Mouse Event Listening

Lark Mini-Program Widget desktop versions also support mouse events, so you can bind `mousemove`, `mouseover`, etc. **But be careful to handle event conflicts (this requires handling at your own business level)**.

```html
<!-- index.ttml  -->
<canvas
  class="cs-canvas"
  id="line_draw_canvas"
  canvas-id="line_draw_canvas"
  bindmousemove="bindChartEvent"
  bindmouseover="bindChartEvent"
></canvas>
```
