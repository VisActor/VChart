## Implementation of BaseChart

In react-vchart, the encapsulation of all charts is achieved through the higher-order component `createChart`. Next, we will take the implementation of `<VChart />` as an example to explain the implementation principle in detail.



### 1.1 Explanation of `<VChart />` Encapsulation

The encapsulation of `<VChart />` is as follows:


```javascript
export const VChart = createChart<VChartProps>('VChart', {
  vchartConstrouctor: VChartCore
});    

```
This code is relatively simple and includes the following content:

1. Use the `createChart` factory function to create a component

2. Specify the component name as `VChart`

3. Inject the `VChartCore` constructor



### 1.2 Basic Chart Implementation (BaseChart.tsx)



#### 1.2.1 State Management


```Typescript
const [updateId, setUpdateId] = useState<number>(0);
const chartContext = useRef<ChartContextType>({});
const [view, setView] = useState<IView>(null);
const isUnmount = useRef<boolean>(false);    

```


Key States:    

*  `updateId`: Used to control the update of subcomponents.    

*  `chartContext`: Used to store chart instances.    

*  `view`: Used to store view instances.    

*  `isUnmount`: Used to control the unmount state of the component.    

#### 1.2.2 Spec Parsing System

```xml
const parseSpec = (props: Props) => {
    let spec: ISpec;
    // 1. 处理直接传入的 spec
    if (hasSpec && props.spec) {
        spec = props.spec;
        if (isValid(props.data)) {
            spec = {
              ...props.spec,
                data: props.data
            };
        }
    }
    // 2. 处理从子组件收集的 spec
    else {
        spec = {
          ...prevSpec.current,
          ...specFromChildren.current
        };
    }
    // 3. 处理 tooltip
    const tooltipSpec = initCustomTooltip(setTooltipNode, props, spec.tooltip);
    if (tooltipSpec) {
        spec.tooltip = tooltipSpec;
    }
    return spec;
};    

```
The Spec parsing system includes three levels:

1. Directly passed spec configuration.

2. Aggregation of subcomponent configurations.

3. Handling of special components (such as tooltip).

#### 1.2.3 Subcomponent Parsing System


```xml
const parseSpecFromChildren = (props: Props) => {
    const specFromChildren: Omit<ISpec, 'type' | 'data' | 'width' | 'height'> = {};
    toArray(props.children).map((child, index) => {
        const parseSpec = child?.type?.parseSpec;
        if (parseSpec && child.props) {
            // 处理子组件配置...
            const specResult = parseSpec(childProps);
            // 处理单例和数组配置
            if (specResult.isSingle) {
                specFromChildren[specResult.specName] = specResult.spec;
            } else {
                if (!specFromChildren[specResult.specName]) {
                    specFromChildren[specResult.specName] = [];
                }
                specFromChildren[specResult.specName].push(specResult.spec);
            }
        }
    });
    return specFromChildren;
};    

```
The responsibilities of the system include:    

1. Collecting configurations of all sub-components.    

2. Distinguishing between singleton and array types of configurations.    

3. Generating the final configuration object.    

#### 1.2.4 Update Mechanism

```xml
useEffect(() => {
    // 1. 首次渲染
    if (!chartContext.current?.chart) {
        createChart(props);
        renderChart();
        return;
    }
    // 2. spec 更新
    if (hasSpec) {
        if (!isEqual(eventsBinded.current.spec, props.spec)) {
            chartContext.current.chart.updateSpecSync(parseSpec(props));
            handleChartRender(true);
        }
        // 3. 数据更新
        else if (eventsBinded.current.data!== props.data) {
            chartContext.current.chart.updateFullDataSync(props.data);
            handleChartRender(true);
        }
        return;
    }
    // 4. 子组件更新
    const newSpec = pickWithout(props, notSpecKeys);
    if (!isEqual(newSpec, prevSpec.current)) {
        // 更新处理...
    }
}, [props]);    

```
The update mechanism covers the following four scenarios:

1. Initial rendering

2. Spec configuration update

3. Data update

4. Updates caused by subcomponents

#### 1.2.4 Lifecycle Management


```xml
useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
        if (chartContext.current?.chart) {
            chartContext.current.chart.release();
            chartContext.current.chart = null;
        }
        eventsBinded.current = null;
        isUnmount.current = true;
    };
}, []);    

```
When the component is destroyed, ensure that resources can be released, including:

* Release chart instances

* Clean up event bindings

* Update component status

## Implementation of BaseComponent

### 2.1 Core Implementation Mechanism

In the react-vchart framework, the creation of all components relies on the `createComponent` factory function. The definition of this function is as follows:

```xml
const createComponent = <T extends ComponentProps>(
    componentName: string,    // 组件名
    specName: string,        // 规格名称
    supportedEvents?: Record<string, string>,  // 支持的事件
    isSingle?: boolean,      // 是否单例
    registers?: (() => void)[]  // 注册器
): any => {
    // ...组件创建逻辑
};    

```
Here, the generic `T extends ComponentProps` is used to constrain the type of component properties passed in. The function receives multiple parameters:

* `componentName`: Used to identify the name of the component, which is unique throughout the application, making it easy for developers to recognize and manage components.

* `specName`: Represents the specification name corresponding to the component, which is very important for configuration collection and management. Different components are distinguished by different specification names for their respective configurations.

* `supportedEvents`: An optional object used to define the events supported by the component. The key-value pair form of the object represents the event type and the corresponding event handling logic. For example, a component may support the `click` event and define the corresponding handler function.

* `isSingle`: A boolean value used to indicate whether the component is in singleton mode. If `true`, it means that there will only be one instance of the component in the entire application; if `false`, multiple instances can be created.

* `registers`: An array of functions, each used to perform specific registration operations. These registration operations may include registering specific functions or plugins of the component into the framework.

To understand more intuitively, the following shows the encapsulation code using the axis component and legend component as examples:

* **Axis**

```xml
export const Axis = createComponent<AxisProps>('Axis', 'axes');    

```
Here, a coordinate axis component named `Axis` is created, the component name is `Axis`, and the corresponding specification name is `axes`. In this way, the framework can accurately identify and handle the relevant configurations and operations of the coordinate axis component.    

*  **Legend**    

```xml
export const Legend = createComponent<LegendProps>(
    'Legend',
    'legends',
    LEGEND_CUSTOMIZED_EVENTS,
    false,
    [registerDiscreteLegend]
);    

```
This code creates a `Legend` component, with the component name being `Legend` and the specification name being `legends`. It also specifies the custom events supported by this component `LEGEND_CUSTOMIZED_EVENTS`, and the component is not in singleton mode (`false`). Finally, a registrar function `registerDiscreteLegend` is passed in to perform specific registration operations, which may be to register discrete data-related functions for the legend component.    

### 2.2 Component Communication Mechanism

#### 2.2.1 Context Communication


```xml
const Comp: React.FC<T> = (props: T) => {
    const context = useContext(RootChartContext);
    // ...
};    

```
In a React application, communication between components is an important issue. Here, the `useContext` hook function is used to achieve communication between components. `RootChartContext` is a context object that contains information related to charts, such as chart instances, global configurations, etc. By using `useContext(RootChartContext)`, components can access this global information to achieve data sharing and interaction between components. For example, a child component may need to obtain the global configuration information of the chart to adjust its display mode, and it can obtain context information in this way.

#### 2.2.2 Event System


```xml
// 事件绑定
if (supportedEvents) {
    bindEventsToChart(
        context.chart,
        props,
        eventsBinded.current,
        supportedEvents
    );
}    

```
This part of the code implements the event binding functionality of the component. When the component defines `supportedEvents` (i.e., supported events), the `bindEventsToChart` function is called to bind events. This function receives four parameters:

* `context.chart`: Represents the chart instance, obtained through the context. Events are bound to this chart instance so that the handling logic can be triggered when the chart experiences corresponding events.

* `props`: The properties of the component, which may include configuration information related to events, such as event handler functions.

* `eventsBinded.current`: Possibly an object or variable that stores the events that have already been bound, used to record the currently bound events to avoid duplicate bindings.

* `supportedEvents`: The aforementioned object of events supported by the component, containing the mapping relationship between event types and handler functions. In this way, the component can interact with the chart instance to achieve the association between user operations and component behavior.

### 2.3 Configuration Collection Mechanism

Each component implements the `parseSpec` method to parse the configuration corresponding to the component, ultimately assembling it into the complete `spec` required by vchart:


```xml
Comp.parseSpec = (props: T) => {
    return {
        spec: pickWithout(props, notSpecKeys),
        specName,
        isSingle
    };
};    

```
`parseSpec` method plays a key role in component configuration management. It receives the component's `props` as a parameter and returns an object containing three attributes:

* `spec`: The component configuration obtained through the `pickWithout(props, notSpecKeys)` method. The `pickWithout` function might be a custom function used to filter out the required configuration information from `props`, excluding unnecessary keys (`notSpecKeys`). This configuration information will be used as the actual configuration for the component in vchart.

* `specName`: The aforementioned component specification name, used to identify the type of component configuration, facilitating differentiation and management in the overall configuration.

* `isSingle`: A boolean value indicating whether the component is in singleton mode. This information is also crucial in the process of configuration assembly and management, for example, when handling multiple component configurations, it is necessary to decide how to merge configurations based on the value of `isSingle`. By implementing the `parseSpec` method for each component, the framework can collect the configuration information of each component and ultimately assemble it into a complete configuration `spec` that meets vchart requirements.

### 2.4 Component Registration Mechanism


```xml
if (registers && registers.length) {
    VChart.useRegisters(registers);
}    

```
This part of the code implements the component registration mechanism. When a component defines `registers` (i.e., an array of registrars) and the array is not empty, the `VChart.useRegisters(registers)` method is called. `VChart` may be a global chart object or a framework core object, and the `useRegisters` method is used to register functions from the registrar array into the framework. These registrar functions may be used to register specific features, plugins, or integrations with other modules for the component. In this way, the component can register some of its special features or configurations into the framework to function throughout the application.

### 2.5 Configuration Filtering


```xml
const notSpecKeys = supportedEvents 
   ? Object.keys(supportedEvents).concat(ignoreKeys) 
    : ignoreKeys;    

```
This code implements the configuration filtering function. The `notSpecKeys` variable is used to store unwanted configuration keys. If the component defines `supportedEvents` (i.e., supported events), then `notSpecKeys` is formed by merging all keys of `supportedEvents` with `ignoreKeys`; otherwise, `notSpecKeys` is directly equal to `ignoreKeys`. `ignoreKeys` may be a predefined array containing some keys that need to be ignored during the configuration parsing process. In this way, during the configuration collection and parsing process, unwanted configuration information can be excluded, ensuring that the final configuration `spec` only contains useful information, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of the configuration.

### 2.6 Update Control


```xml
if (props.updateId!== updateId.current) {
    updateId.current = props.updateId;
    // 处理更新逻辑...
}    

```
This part of the code implements the update control of the component. `updateId` is an identifier used to control component updates. When the `props.updateId` received by the component is not equal to the currently stored `updateId.current`, it indicates that an update has occurred. At this point, `updateId.current` is updated to `props.updateId`, and then the subsequent update logic is executed (indicated in the code by the comment `// Handle update logic...`). This update control mechanism ensures that when the component receives a new update identifier, it can correctly handle update operations, such as re-rendering the component, updating data, or performing specific update tasks, thereby ensuring that the component's state remains consistent with the latest requirements.

## Implementation of BaseSeries

The series components of React-VChart are also mainly implemented using higher-order components. The following will provide a more detailed analysis of its core implementation.

### 3.1 Series Component Creator

```xml
export const createSeries = <T extends BaseSeriesProps>(
  componentName: string,   // 组件名称
  markNames: string[],     // 图形标记名称
  type?: string,          // 图表类型
  registers?: (() => void)[]  // 注册函数
) => {
  //...
}    

```
This factory function plays a core role in the creation process of the entire series of components. It strictly constrains the type of component properties passed in through the generic `\u003CT extends BaseSeriesProps\u003E`, ensuring type safety.    

The parameters received by the function have their own important responsibilities:    

*  `componentName`: Serves as the unique identifier of the component, having uniqueness throughout the application. This makes it more convenient for developers to manage and identify components, just like giving each component a unique "name tag".    

*  `markNames`: An array of series element names used to determine the elements used by the component.    

*  `type`: The chart type, although an optional parameter, clarifies the chart type corresponding to the component.    

*  `registers`: Declares the resources that the series needs to register, used for on-demand loading through tree-shaking to achieve package size optimization.    

### 3.2 Area Component Implementation

```xml
export type AreaProps = BaseSeriesProps & Omit<IAreaSeriesSpec, 'type'>;
export const Area = createSeries<AreaProps>(
  'Area',              // 组件名
  ['area'],           // 图形标记
  'area',             // 类型
  [registerAreaSeries] // 注册器
);    

```
`Area` 组件的定义首先通过 `export type AreaProps = BaseSeriesProps & Omit<IAreaSeriesSpec, 'type'>` 来定义其属性类型。它结合了 `BaseSeriesProps` 和 `IAreaSeriesSpec`，并通过 `Omit` 操作排除了 `'type'` 属性，这是因为在创建组件时，类型已经通过 `createSeries` 函数的参数进行了指定。    

然后，通过 `createSeries` 函数创建 `Area` 组件。传入的参数分别为组件名 `'Area'`、图形标记 `['area']`、图表类型 `'area'` 以及注册器 `[registerAreaSeries]`。注册器 `registerAreaSeries` 用于执行与面积图相关的特定注册操作，可能包括注册面积图的样式、动画效果等。    

### 3.3 核心功能实现

*  **标记 ID 管理**    

```xml
const addMarkId = (spec: any, seriesId: string | number) => {
  markNames.forEach(markName => {
    const defaultMarkId = `${seriesId}-${markName}`;
    if (isNil(spec[markName])) {
      spec[markName] = { id: defaultMarkId };
    } else if (isNil(spec[markName].id)) {
      spec[markName].id = defaultMarkId;
    }
  });
};    

```
In the process of chart rendering, each graphic mark needs to have a unique identifier, which is the role of mark ID management. The `addMarkId` function receives `spec` (configuration object) and `seriesId` (series ID) as parameters.

The function generates a default `markId` for each graphic mark by traversing the `markNames` array. The generation rule is to concatenate `seriesId` and `markName` with `-`, for example, `'series1-area'`.

If a property corresponding to a `markName` does not exist in `spec`, an object containing the default `markId` is created; if the `markName` property exists but `id` does not, the default `markId` is set for it. This ensures that each graphic mark has a unique identifier, facilitating subsequent event handling and style setting operations.

* **Event Handling System**

```xml
const handleEvent = (e: any) => {
  const markIds = markNames.map(markName =>
    `${id}-${markName}`
  );
  if (e?.mark && markIds.includes(e.mark.getUserId())) {
    props[VCHART_TO_REACT_EVENTS[e.event.type]](e);
  }
};    

```
The event handling system is responsible for processing user interactions with the chart. The `handleEvent` function receives an event object `e`.    

First, generate all possible `markId` arrays `markIds` through the `markNames` array. Then check whether the `mark` in the event object `e` exists and whether the user ID of `mark` is in the `markIds` array.    

If the conditions are met, it indicates that the event is triggered by the graphic mark of the current component. Then, find the corresponding event handler through `props[VCHART_TO_REACT_EVENTS[e.event.type]]` and pass the event object `e` into it to perform the corresponding operation. `VCHART_TO_REACT_EVENTS` is a mapping table used to map VChart's event types to React component's event handlers.    

*  **Configuration Parsing**    

```xml
Comp.parseSpec = (compProps: T) => {
  const newSeriesSpec = pickWithout<T>(compProps, notSpecKeys);
  // 添加标记 ID
  addMarkId(newSeriesSpec, compProps.id?? compProps.componentId);
  // 设置类型
  if (!isNil(type)) {
    newSeriesSpec.type = type;
  }
  return {
    spec: newSeriesSpec,
    specName:'series'
  };
};    

```
The configuration parsing function `Comp.parseSpec` is responsible for parsing the component's properties into a configuration object that meets the requirements of VChart.

First, the function `pickWithout<T>(compProps, notSpecKeys)` is used to filter out the required configuration information from `compProps`, excluding unnecessary keys `notSpecKeys`. `notSpecKeys` may contain some properties unrelated to event handling or other aspects, ensuring the purity of the configuration object in this way.

Then, the `addMarkId` function is called to add a mark ID to the new series configuration `newSeriesSpec`, ensuring that each graphic mark has a unique identifier.

Next, if the `type` parameter is not empty, the chart type is set in `newSeriesSpec`.

Finally, an object containing `spec` (the parsed configuration object) and `specName` (the configuration type name, here as `'series'`) is returned. This object will be passed to VChart for rendering as the final configuration.

Through the detailed analysis above, we have gained a deeper understanding of the implementation principles of the React-VChart series components, including component creation, property definition, and the implementation of core functions. These technical principles provide a solid foundation for developers when using and extending React-VChart.
