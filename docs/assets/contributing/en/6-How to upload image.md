# How to Upload Images
Tutorial documents often require the use of images to aid in explanation.
We recommend using a stable image hosting service to upload images. Here, we introduce the cdn.jsdelivr.net image hosting solution.

## 6.1 Uploading Images
First, create a folder in your personal GitHub repository to store the images used in the documents.
For example, the directory https://github.com/xuanhun/articles/tree/main/visactor/img stores a large number of images. Taking A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif as an example, the corresponding GitHub URL is:
https://github.com/xuanhun/articles/blob/main/visactor/img/A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif.

In the specific md document, we convert it to a cdn.jsdelivr.net URL:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/[username]/[repo name]/[image path]

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xuanhun/articles/visactor/img/A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif
