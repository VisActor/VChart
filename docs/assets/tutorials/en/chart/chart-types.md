To set the default chart type, use:
```
{ 
    type: 'line' ,
    data: []
}
```
You can also combine multiple chart series flexibly and freely by using combination charts:
```
{
    type: 'common',
    series: [{
        type: 'line',
        data: []
    }, {
        type: 'bar',
        data: []
    }]
}
```
For more information about how to declare combination charts, please refer to [VChart commonChart Options](../../../option/commonChart).
